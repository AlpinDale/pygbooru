      <p>Before giving a user negative feedback, you must communicate with them privately first to tell them what
      they're doing wrong and how to improve. A negative feedback should only be given after they've been warned first,
      unless the user is deliberately breaking the <%= link_to_wiki "site rules", "help:community rules" %>, such as engaging
      in intentional vandalism or ban evasion.</p>

      <p>A neutral feedback can be given for less serious offenses, or as an initial warning before giving a negative.</p>

      <p>Please consult <%= link_to_wiki "help:user records" %> for more information on giving user feedbacks.</p>
