# Calculates a user's upload limit:
#
# * Each status:pending post takes up one upload slot.
# * Each status:appealed post takes up three upload slots.
# * If any of your uploads are manually deleted in under three days (status:deleted age:<3d), they take up five upload slots.
# * Slots are freed when uploads are approved or deleted.
# * You start out with 15 upload slots and can have between 5 and 40 upload slots.
# * You gain and lose slots based on approvals and deletions:
# ** You lose a slot for every 3 deletions.
# ** You gain a slot for every N approved uploads, where N depends on how many slots you already have:
# *** If you have 15 slots or less, then you gain a slot for every 10 approved uploads.
# *** If you have more than 15 slots, then you need 10 approvals, plus 2 more per upload slot over 15.
#
# Internally, upload limits are based on a point system, where you start with
# 1000 points and level up to 10,000 points. Each approval is worth 10 points
# and each deletion costs 1/3 of the points to the next level. Points are mapped
# to levels such that each level costs 20 more points (2 approvals) than the
# last. Levels are mapped to upload slots such that levels range from 0 - 35,
# and upload slots range from 5 - 40.
