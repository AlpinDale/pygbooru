# frozen_string_literal: true

# A TCPSocket wrapper that disallows connections to local or private IPs. Used
# by {Danbooru::Http} to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. For
# example, if we try to download an image from http://example.com/image.jpg, but
# example.com resolves to 127.0.0.1, then the request is prohibited.
